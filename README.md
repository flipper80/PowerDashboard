A code in Qt /QML to be used to display "live power" of a treshing chamber. Power is displayed by 2 sets of "moving"rectangles: firt ones representing basic hydraulic power (Pressure x flow), second set: same powers as mechanical power
(Torque x RPM). Mechanical power rectangles are also moving alongside a moving radius terminated by an arc. A fix arc on the outside shows maximum power that should not be overrided..
We expect this "live display" will help drivers for vining peas harvesters to make best choices of adjustments
